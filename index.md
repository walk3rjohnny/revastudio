## CANDY BALL STACK BREAK

A game that will test you agility, quick reflexes and strategic vision! If the answer is yes, then you should definitely try Candy ball — an amazing 3D game that will bring you tons of fun but will require concentration and creative thinking in order for you to win big.

The rules are super simple!
Your task is to get a candy through an obstacle course. The more obstacles you pass the higher is your speed. Multicolored moving platforms will get in your way and most of them can easily be broken to let your ball go further. But beware of the black ones! Once you hit the black platform, your ball will crash and you’ll have to start all over again.
